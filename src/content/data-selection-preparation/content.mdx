_Come back and rework this when I actually have an appreciation for what's going on. For now it's just a collection of thoughts and observations!_

## Some reasons to do data preparation

- Machine learning algorithms require data to be numbers.
- Some machine learning algorithms impose requirements on the data.
- Statistical noise and errors in the data may need to be corrected.
- Complex nonlinear relationships may be teased out of the data.

## Data preparation tasks

Some of these or all may need to be performed, depending on the raw data we are dealign with.

- **Data cleaning** involves identifying and correcting mistakes or errors in the data.
- **Feature selection** identifies those input variables that are most relevant to the task.
- **Data Transforms** involves changing the scale or distribution of variables.
- **Feature Engineering** is to derive new variables from the pre-existing data.
- **Dimensionality Reduction** creates compact projections of the data.

## Feature identification

Given the below dataset we might want to be able to predict a film's `rating` based on some other metrics(s). In the this scenario the `rating` is our _target_ and the other metric(s) would be our feature(s). So the first step here is to determine which column(s), if any, have a strong correlation with the rating. This would be part of performing the _Exploratory Data Analysis_.

However from the below, and knowing the dataset total is 250 films it seems unlikely we could find a meaningful and strong correlation!

<DatasetHead fileName="imdb-top-250-movies.csv" dropColumns={['Description']} />

We could test the correlation of features to the target using **Linear Regression**, and we would test the effectiveness with **Loss Functions** such as **Mean Squared Error**, **Coefficient of Determination (R<sup>2</sup>)** or others.

#### Mean Squared Error

$$MSE=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\hat{y_i})^2$$

#### Coefficient of Determination, R<sup>2</sup>

$$R^2=1-\frac{SSE}{SST}$$

_SSE: Sum of Squared Errors_  
_SST: Sum of Total Squares_

Cleaning the data may involve analysing **residuals** and removing **outliers** from the raw data.
