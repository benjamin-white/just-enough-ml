**_TODO:_**  
_Come back and rework this when I actually have an appreciation for what's going on. For now it's just a collection of thoughts and observations!_

Selecting a model overlaps with data preparation, as ultimately data may need to be prepared in different ways to work with different models. There is an iterative exploratory process that may involve _evaluate, test and repeat_ when finding the most appropriate model to use.

#### Categories of model

- Supervised
  - Classification
  - Regression / Forecasting
- Semi-supervised (the same as Supervised but involves an amount of unlabelled data)
- Unsupervised
  - Clustering
  - Dimension reduction
- Reinforcement (trial and error learning)

### Most commonly uses types of model ([reference](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2020/12/09/machine-learning-algorithm-use/))

- Na√Øve Bayes Classifier Algorithm (Supervised Learning - Classification)
- K Means Clustering Algorithm (Unsupervised Learning - Clustering)
- Support Vector Machine Algorithm (Supervised Learning - Classification)
- Linear Regression (Supervised Learning - Regression)
- Logistic Regression (Sigmoid) (Supervised learning - Regression / Classification)
- Artificial Neural Networks (Reinforcement Learning)
- Decision Trees (Supervised Learning - Classification / Regression)
- Random Forests (Supervised Learning - Classification / Regression)
- K-Nearest Neighbours (Supervised Learning)

**Linear Regression example**

A simple Linear Regression example using a car dataset and the aim of correlating MPG with horsepower.

  **Scatterplot of the available data points**

  **Summary of the regression model we might use**
  <LinearRegression.Summary />
  **Running this model with 50 epochs**
  <LinearRegression.Prediction />
  Clearly the relationship is not linear! A Logistic Regression is likely to
  yield better results here.
